# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) form the foundation of computer science and software engineering. They help us design efficient, scalable, and optimized solutions to computational problems.

A **data structure** is a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

An **algorithm** is a step-by-step procedure or set of instructions used to solve a specific problem.

## Why DSA is Important

- Improves problem-solving skills  
- Helps write optimized and efficient code  
- Essential for technical interviews  
- Forms the base of system design and advanced computing
